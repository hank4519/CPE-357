There are no special instructions running my program. 
'make' creates the executable
'make test' runs the class test cases 

Additional comment: 
This has to be the hardest program I have worked on. Worked on it for a 
good one and half week and didn't manage to get it done. I feel like one 
of the issues I had was unable to test my program along the way when I
wrote my code. So when the program got big at the end, it was hard for 
me to pinpoint where went wrong. Also, I documented all my codes, and I
wish you could briefly go over it, and let me know if I had any conceptual
errors when approaching these three operations. Because you told us your 
program is like having 1500 lines of code, but mines are only like 700 lines 
of code, which being said, I must have missed some important details. This 
program is challenging, I'd love to see how you approahced this tar problem,
so I would really appreciate if you could post a solution on your website like 
you did for Program 1 and 2. Finally, I appreciate all of your help, like
replying my emails over the weekends and stuff. Thank you.
