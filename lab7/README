Instruction to run the program: 
Just do a 'make' or 'make all', and it will 
be able to run ./forkit and ./tryit separately


Additional comment: 
This fork() parent child processes is kind of interesting, 
but not sure if it has practical uses. Also the exec program also
seems pretty interesting, replaces the current program...
