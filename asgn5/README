Instruction: 
nothing particular. Just do a make, 
and the rest will be the same as we 
run your demos program. 


Additional comment: 
I agree with you this is indeed a 
pretty interesting program to write. 
And it is pretty cool to be able
to chat. One thing to mention though, I did separate
functions for chatserver() and chatclient() 
even though they're technically the same, I
didn't realize they're the same until I 
finished the program. And I felt like it was ok
to not merge them, and just leave it as it is (and 
it would also probably be better if we wanna do
individual changes to either of them later as well). 
So I hope I don't get points marked off for using 
repetitive codes in a sense.
