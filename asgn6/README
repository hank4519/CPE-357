Hey Professor, thanks for all the help you
gave this quarter. I really appreciate it, 
almost no professor replying emails over the 
weekends like you do. Thanks for that. And I 
learned a ton of stuff tbh, especailly it is 
my first time working in a unix environment
and writing codes in the terminal. 

As of this project, I totally agree with you 
that it was not as difficult as it seems at the
beginning. Because like you said the parsing
part was the difficult stuff and you took care 
of it. Though, I was a bit confused on the piping
stuff at first, and took me several tries and 
re-learning to get that part done. But other 
than that, I guess exec family really just does
everything for us. My failed attempts for pipe
function() was commented out at the end of the 
c file, I did not delete it, but you can just 
ignore that part.

As of the final, the difficulty was intermediate
I would say. One regret was that right after the
final, I realized for the piping problem I forgot 
to close the file descriptors for the parent's copy 
which was a mistake. As you particularly emphasized it
in the lab, it would hang the commands forever. I 
guess I was just too excited getting to the wait
part of question in the final. Anyways, I would 
remember this better now. 

As of the class picture, I noticed that on your 
website, our class picture was not up.  Are you 
like updating the class picture once a year for 
three quarters all together or something? Let me
know when the class picture is up, because I would
love to keep a copy of it and also show it to
my family. They'd love to see it too. 

Anyways, thank you for this quarter. 

Sincerely,
Hank
