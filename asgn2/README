Instruction for running my program: 

use 'make' to make the "all" executable

use 'make test' to run the given testcases


Additional things: 

the purpose of this program seems straightforward, but it was way harder
than I thought because how many cases we need to cover. And had to fix a
bunch of segmentation fault, but after like four days of looking into it. 
I'm glad I finally made it work for all test cases even though they are
not exhaustive. Overall, let me know what you think of my program. Thanks for 
all your help and all the email you responded. A quick note though, I don't get it
 like it how CS department of our school is not giving CPE 357 a TA or tutor duing the lab
 hour, it was like I raised my hand for like 50 minitus and can only get helped once,
 comparing to the 203 I had last quarter, where both professor and TA were pretty much 
free the entire lab period. That is something I don't get it, and hopefully 
if you see my complaint, you can possibly talk to someone in the CS department
about it, and see what they say.
