There is no specific instruction for running the program. 

This program seems like a simple one which replaces tab with spaces. However,
since it contains so many edge cases, so it turned out to be harder than I 
thought. When I first thought it worked, it only passed two test cases. But by
doing this, it definitely made me to think more comprehensive when writing a program.
