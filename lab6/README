Running the program: 

do a make, and after that, we probably have to run that manually, do something like

./timeit 5 (or any other integer number)


Additional comment: 
This timer thing is pretty interesting. Though, those signal operations are not
all that easy to understand exactly what they do. I thoroughly read through the 
man page for the signal handling functions we used in this lab, I kind of get 
the ideas, but not like super clear. But all good, I will just watch lecture 
recordings if I have further confusions.
