Instructions: 

Just do "make" or "make all"
"make test" would run class test cases 


Additional Things:
Hey Professor, I was struggled with a couple test cases that I didn't pass. 
I ran them individually, use od -tx1 compared to the expected output. However, most
of the time, it did not give me any clue where could possibly go wrong inside my
code. And I was just blindly take a guess to see if this and that modification
would fix anything or not. So my general quetsion is like is there a systamatic 
approach for us to debug with inputs like "longcodes" or like "binary", they are
like too long for me to examine each character. So I would be glad if you can give me
some feedback on what could cause it to fail and like what's the general approach
we should take to debug?
